If you dislike this\nfunctionality, you can disable it from the Bracket Matcher section of the\nSettings View.\n\n#### Custom Pairs\n\nYou can customize matching pairs in Bracket Matcher at any time. You can do so either globally via the Settings View or at the scope level via your `config.cson`. Changes take effect immediately.\n\n* **Autocomplete Characters** - Comma-separated pairs that the editor will treat as brackets / quotes. Entries in this field override the package defaults.\n  * For example: `<>, (), []`\n\n* **Pairs With Extra Newline** - Comma-separated pairs that enhance the editor's auto indent feature. When used, a newline is automatically added between the pair when enter is pressed between them. Note: This feature is meant to be used in combination with brackets defined for indentation by the active language package (`increaseIndentPattern` / `decreaseIndentPattern`).\nExample:\n```\nfn main() {\n    | <---- Cursor positioned at one indent level higher\n}\n```\n\n#### Scoped settings\nIn addition to the global settings, you are also able to add scope-specific modifications to Atom in your `config.cson`. This is especially useful for editor rule changes specific to each language. Scope-specific settings override package defaults _and_ global settings.\nExample:\n```cson\n\".rust.source\":\n  \"bracket-matcher\":\n    autocompleteCharacters: [\n      \"()\"\n      \"[]\"\n      \"{}\"\n      \"<>\"\n      \"\\\"\\\"\"\n      \"``\"\n    ]\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/bracket-matcher/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/bracket-matcher#readme","_id":"bracket-matcher@0.85.3","_shasum":"aa39082563483ed66dfbabc7bf4644175d036229","_resolved":"file:../../../../../private/var/folders/sw/wbgckh6d6g5gb9dpvj0jsjjh0000gp/T/d-11729-89205-1f0c30m.32ipjsjor/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../../private/var/folders/sw/wbgckh6d6g5gb9dpvj0jsjjh0000gp/T/d-11729-89205-1f0c30m.32ipjsjor/package.tgz"}
