Finally, all keybindings (including ones that community packages have added) are available in the _Keybindings_ section.\n\nWant to learn more? Check out the [Getting Started: Atom Basics](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#settings-and-preferences) and [Using Atom: Atom Packages](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages) sections in the Atom Flight Manual.\n\n### Commands and Keybindings\nAll of the following commands are under the `atom-workspace` selector.\n\n|Command|Description|Keybinding (Linux)|Keybinding (macOS)|Keybinding (Windows)|\n|-------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n|`settings-view:open`|Opens the Settings View|<kbd>ctrl-,</kbd>|<kbd>cmd-,</kbd>|<kbd>ctrl-,</kbd>|\n|`settings-view:core`|Opens the _Core_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:editor`|Opens the _Editor_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:system`|Opens the _System_ section of the Settings View (Windows)|\n|`settings-view:show-keybindings`|Opens the _Keybindings_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:uninstall-packages`|Opens the _Packages_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:change-themes`|Opens the _Themes_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:uninstall-themes`|Opens the _Themes_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:check-for-updates`|Opens the _Updates_ section of the Settings View|\n|`settings-view:install-packages-and-themes`|Opens the _Install_ section of the Settings View|\nCustom keybindings can be added by referencing the above commands.

You can still customize the UI in your `styles.less` file. For example:\n\n```less\n// Change the color of the titles\n.settings-view .section .section-heading {\n  color: white;\n}\n\n// Change the font size of the setting descriptions\n.settings-view .setting-description {\n  font-size: 13px;\n}\n```\n\nUse the [developer tools](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#developer-tools) to find more selectors.\n\n## Contributing\nAlways feel free to help out!
