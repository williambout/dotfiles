Clicking the device name will open up another view allowing you to choose the device to run the app on.\n\n<img height=\"35px\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2464966/13157360/baa25440-d687-11e5-930e-6da03e1c02fe.png\" />\n\nThe terminal will automatically disappear when CLI finishes without issues, otherwise it stays opened and will highlight the error. You can close it with \"ESC\" key.\n\n### Roadmap\n\nThe current version is a proof of concept to demonstrate we can really hack Atom to fit our needs in less than a day. Below is the list of features I've been thinking about implementing so far. \n\n- [ ] Add ability to select build targets\n- [ ] Add `Xcode` menu item with all options available\n- [ ] Add build command\n- [ ] Improve terminal colors\n- [ ] Improve project detection and support Android as well\n- [ ] Add settings and make this configureable\n- [ ] Decouple from RN cli and ideally ship with own library\n- [ ] Support multiple projects opened in Atom (for now we take the first one)\n\nPlease feel free to submit your ideas by making a new issue.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Command finishes w/o errors, but no Simulator has started\n\nTry choosing different device. This error will be gone when either https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/5978 gets merged, or when we move the `run-ios` into this package (or `rnpm`, who knows)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/grabbou/atom-xcode/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/grabbou/atom-xcode#readme","_id":"atom-xcode@0.1.3","_shasum":"77ca9752b590efb8a4f241c7453bf923648a8da2","_resolved":"file:../d-11739-50504-1oyp903/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11739-50504-1oyp903/package.tgz"}
