It also lets you change the line ending of a file.\n\n## To Use\n\nWhen the package is activated it will show the current line ending of the file in the right side of the status-bar. If a new file is created the line ending will start with the system default: `CRLF` for Windows, `LF` for Mac and Linux, and `CR` for old-style Mac files. If a file contains multiple line-ending types it will display `Mixed`.\n\n### Changing a File's Line Ending\n\nYou can click the line ending in the status-bar to open a modal with the line ending options. Selecting a different line ending will change each line of the file in the active editor.\n\n![modal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305617/9273907/2be5c136-4291-11e5-94af-65ece408eb12.png)\n\n**Line Endings**\n\n- `LF` is \"\\n\"\n- `CRLF` is \"\\r\\n\"\n\n**Note:** Because the `CR` line ending style is not used in any modern operating system, this package only supports converting *from* `CR` line endings not to it.\n\n### Atom Commands\n\nYou can also change a file's line endings by using or <kbd>cmd-shift-P</kbd> searching for these commands:\n\n```text\nline-ending-selector:convert-to-LF\nline-ending-selector:convert-to-CRLF\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/line-ending-selector/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/line-ending-selector#readme","_id":"line-ending-selector@0.6.2","_shasum":"cf164afa4c7ef6148445c686faef7938be930694","_resolved":"file:../../../../../private/var/folders/sw/wbgckh6d6g5gb9dpvj0jsjjh0000gp/T/d-11729-89205-c3fi73.72y69lik9/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../../private/var/folders/sw/wbgckh6d6g5gb9dpvj0jsjjh0000gp/T/d-11729-89205-c3fi73.72y69lik9/package.tgz"}
