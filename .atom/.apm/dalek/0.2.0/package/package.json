This package is intended to notify people when they are in this precarious position so they can take corrective action.\n\n## I got a warning, what do I do?\n\n1. Note down the packages named in the notification\n1. Exit Atom\n1. Open a command prompt\n1. For each package named in the notification, execute `apm uninstall [package-name]`\n1. Start Atom again normally to verify that the warning notification no longer appears\n\n## I have more questions. Where can I ask them?\n\nPlease feel free to ask on [the official Atom message board](https://discuss.atom.io/c/support).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/dalek/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/dalek#readme","_id":"dalek@0.2.0","_shasum":"b7174be884f579e6f90ea80db6d437df85e1e988","_resolved":"file:../../../../../private/var/folders/sw/wbgckh6d6g5gb9dpvj0jsjjh0000gp/T/d-11729-89205-7gv9qp.od7z257b9/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../../private/var/folders/sw/wbgckh6d6g5gb9dpvj0jsjjh0000gp/T/d-11729-89205-7gv9qp.od7z257b9/package.tgz"}
