Inside Atom, navigate to `Preferences`/`Settings` -> `Install` and search for `wakatime`.\n\n  ![Project Overview](https://wakatime.com/static/img/ScreenShots/atom-wakatime-install-1.png)\n\n2. Click the `Install` button.\n\n  ![Project Overview](https://wakatime.com/static/img/ScreenShots/atom-wakatime-install-2.png)\n\n3. Click `Settings`, then enter your [api key](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey).\n\n4. Use Atom like you normally do and your time will automatically be tracked for you.\n\n5. Visit <https://wakatime.com> to see your logged time.\n\n## Screen Shots\n\n![Project Overview](https://wakatime.com/static/img/ScreenShots/Screen-Shot-2016-03-21.png)\n\n## Configuring\n\nSettings for atom-wakatime are under `Settings -> Packages -> wakatime -> Settings`.\n\nAdditional settings are in `$HOME/.wakatime.cfg` for [wakatime cli](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#configuring).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nAtom writes errors to the Atom Developer Console. To check for errors:\n\n1. Turn on the debug checkbox in `Settings -> Packages -> wakatime -> Settings`\n2. Inside Atom, go to `View -> Developer -> Toggle Developer Tools`\n3. Clear the developer console (the circle button top left of the console)\n4. Inside Atom, go to `View -> Developer -> Reload Window`\n\nThat will reload all plugins including WakaTime, and you should see the startup process logged in the developer console.\nIf there are no errors in your developer console after startup and editing a file, then check for errors in your `~/.wakatime.log` file.\n\nFor checking your `~/.wakatime.log` file, see [wakatime/wakatime#troubleshooting](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#troubleshooting).\n\nNote: Behind a proxy?
